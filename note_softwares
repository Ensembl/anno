DustMasker is a program that identifies and masks out low complexity
    parts of a genome using a new and improved DUST algorithm. The main
    advantages of the new algorithm are symmetry with respect to taking
    reverse complements, context insensitivity, and much better performance.
    The new DUST algorithm is described in [1]. Please cite this paper in
    any publication that uses DustMasker.

Infernal and its "cmsearch" tool are used for detecting sncRNAs in sequence databases.
sncRNA diversity: Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) constitute a diverse group of RNA
molecules that play critical roles in various cellular processes, including gene regulation,
RNA interference, and post-transcriptional modifications. There are different types of sncRNAs,
such as microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs).
Despite their small size, many sncRNAs exhibit conserved structural features or sequence motifs
across species, essential to identify and study them.
Covariance models (CMs) can represent conserved RNA secondary structures as well as conserved
sequence patterns. This makes them well-suited for detecting sncRNAs in sequence databases.

GenBlast identifies homologous gene sequences in genomic databases.
One of the key features of GenBlast is its flexibility to handle
comparative genomics tasks and accurately identify homologs even when
the sequences have undergone significant evolutionary changes.
This capability makes it a valuable resource for researchers studying gene
evolution, gene families, and gene function across diverse species.

GenBlast has been widely used in various genomic analyses and is available as
a standalone command-line tool or as part of different bioinformatics pipelines.
Researchers in the field of comparative genomics and gene function analysis
often rely on GenBlast to perform sensitive homology searches and obtain
valuable insights into the evolutionary relationships and functional conservation
of genes in different organisms.
